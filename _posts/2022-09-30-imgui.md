# Description

ImGUI (Immediate Mode GUI) helps to define interface that can be use for debugging easily your code. 

Interface can be spawned anywhere in the code, as long as it's part of the game loop:

```kotlin
with(ImGui) {
            container("Demo ImGUI") {
                label("Example of label")
                if(button("Counter: $counter")) {
                    counter = (counter + 1) % 10
                }
                checkbox("Counter above 5", counter > 5)
            }
        }
```
