# Controls

- ⎵ to switch to the next camera
- ← and → to switch to the next/previous camera

# Description

Change the camera position and characteristics. 
The transition to another position is done using a linear interpolation.

```kotlin
val percent = compute() //. progress of the interpolation

// Interpolation of the camera's transform (ie: position)
val transformation = Interpolations.interpolate(
    targetEntity.position.localTransformation,
    entity.position.localTransformation,
    percent
)
entity.position.setLocalTransform(transformation)

// Interpolation of the Field Of View (fov) of the camera
val targetFov = targetEntity.get(CameraSpot::class).camera.fov
camera.fov = Interpolations.interpolate(targetFov, camera.fov, percent)
```
